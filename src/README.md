# when i click the "add to total button"
## "store" the values in the input fields
values will be stored inside of an array of objects to be referenced and manipulated later
	-create an array to store card information (array of object) 
 		- should be fairly easy given the card information is already stored in an object
Once the values are "stored", meaning moved to, the array of object;
	-push out a message letting the user know that data was successfully stored
		-wasnt in our figma but I dont see why we wouldnt do this so the user 
		 doesnt think their data was just deleted in the next step
	-the input fields should be cleared of data
